        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>In general, a maturity model is a set of characteristics, attributes, indicators, or patterns that represent
            capability and
            progression in a particular discipline. The content of such a model typically exemplifies best practices and
            may incorporate
            standards or other codes of practice of that discipline. A maturity model thus provides a benchmark against
            which an
            organization can evaluate the current level of capability of its processes, practices, and methods and set
            goals and
            priorities for improvement.</p>

        <p>The CMMC assessment process provides consistent guidance for assessing a contractor against a specific CMMC
            level.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)</h5>
        <p>
            CMMC stands for “Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification” and is a unifying standard for the
            implementation of cybersecurity across the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). The CMMC framework includes a
            comprehensive and scalable certification element to verify the implementation of processes and practices
            associated with the achievement of a cybersecurity maturity level. CMMC is designed to provide increased
            assurance to the Department that a DIB company can adequately protect sensitive unclassified information,
            accounting for information flow down to subcontractors in a multi-tier supply chain.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>CMMC Levels and Focus Areas</h5>
        <p>
            CMMC Levels 1 through 3 consist of the security requirements specified in National Institute of Standards
            and Technology
            (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal
            Systems and
            Organizations. Levels 1 through 3 also include an additional 20 CMMC specific- practices along with 3 CMMC
            maturity
            processes for each of the 17 CMMC domains.
        </p>

        <p>
            CMMC Levels 4 and 5 include a subset of the enhanced security requirements from NIST SP 800-171B as well as
            other
            cybersecurity best practices and show that the contractor is capable of reducing the risk of Advanced
            Persistent Threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a contractor moves toward Level 5, they are required to standardize and optimize process implementation
            across the organization.

        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Setting the Target Level</h5>

        <p>
            The first step to completing the CMMC practice questions is to set your desired target level. If you are
            unsure of your
            target level, check your RFI or RFP documents for the required CMMC compliance level for your contract or
            choose your
            level based on the following guidance. Additional guidance on CMMC Levels can be found in the CSET Resource
            Library's
            ollection of CMMC materials. Recommended reading includes the

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 1</h5>

        <p>
            Level 1 safeguards Federal Contract Information (FCI). Level 1 encompasses the basic safeguarding
            requirements for
            FCI specified in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.204-21, which defines FCI as:
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Information, not intended for public release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under
                a contract to develop
                or deliver a product or service to the Government, but not including information provided by the
                Government to the public (such
                as on public websites) or simple transactional information, such as necessary to process payments.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Department of Defense (DoD) contracts that specify the need for a contractor to process, store, or transmit
            FCI only require
            the contractor to comply with CMMC Level 1 practices. There is no CMMC process maturity assessed at Level 1.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 2</h5>
        <p>
            Level 2 is a transitional level. At Level 2, a contractor is not yet approved for CUI. CMMC Level 2
            practices and processes
            provide additional safeguarding above CMMC Level 1 and help to prepare a contractor to handle CUI at CMMC
            Level 3.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 2</h5>
        <p>
            CMMC Level 3 addresses the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The National Archives
            and Record Administration (NARA) defines CUI as:
        </p>
        <p><em>
                Information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with laws,
                regulations, and government-wide policies, excluding information that is classified under Executive
                Order 13526, Classified National Security
                Information, December 29, 2009, or any predecessor or successor order, or Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
                amended.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            A CMMC Level 3 assessment encompasses the practices and processes of CMMC Levels 1, 2, and 3. CMMC Level 3
            shows
            that a contractor can adequately protect CUI at the appropriate risk level while accounting for
            subcontractor information
            flow in a multi-tier supply chain.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 4</h5>
        <p>
            Level 4 provides increased assurance to the DoD that a contractor is capable of protecting CUI while
            working to reduce the
            risk of Advanced Persistent Threats and focuses on the protection of CUI from APTs. It encompasses
            cybersecurity best
            practices along with enhanced security requirements from NIST SP 800-171B . These practices enhance the
            detection and
            response capabilities of an organization to address and adapt to the changing tactics, techniques,and
            procedures (TTPs) used
            by APTs.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 5</h5>
        <p>
            Level 5 continues the focus on the protection of CUI from APTs and requires a contractor to standardize and
            optimize process implementation across the organization.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="mb-4">
        <h4>CMMC Practice Questions</h4>

        <p> The CMMC model measures not only process maturity or institutionalization, but also the implementation of
            practices.
            The model consists of 171 practices that are mapped across the five levels for all capabilities and domains.
            This mapping
            and the cumulative nature of the model is shown in Figure 2 below.

    </div>





    <div class="alert alert-danger my-5">OLD STUFF BELOW HERE</div>







    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Assessment Criteria and Methodology</h5>
        <p>The CMMC assessment procedure leverages the Assessment Procedure defined in National Institute of Standards
            and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171A Section 2.1:</p>

        <p class="font-italic">An assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of potential
            assessment methods and assessment objects that can be used to conduct the assessment. Each assessment
            objective includes a determination statement related to the [CMMC practice] that is the subject of the
            assessment. The determination statements are linked to the content of the [CMMC practice] to ensure
            traceability of the assessment results to the requirements. The application of an assessment procedure to a
            practice produces assessment findings. These findings reflect, or are subsequently used, to help determine
            if the practice has been satisfied.</p>

        <p class="font-italic">
            Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and can include specifications, mechanisms,
            activities, and individuals.
        </p>


        <ul class="font-italic">
            <li>Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g., policies, procedures, security plans, security
                requirements, functional specifications, and architectural designs) associated with a system.</li>
            <li>Mechanisms are the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards employed within a system.</li>
            <li>Activities are the protection-related actions supporting a system that involve people (e.g., conducting
                system backup operations, exercising a contingency plan, and monitoring network traffic).</li>
            <li>Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people applying the specifications, mechanisms, or activities
                described above.</li>
            <li>The assessment methods define the nature and the extent of the [Certified] Assessor’s actions. The
                methods include examine, interview, and test.</li>
            <li>The examine method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing assessment
                objects (i.e., specifications, mechanisms, activities). The purpose of the examine method is to
                facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.</li>
            <li>The interview method is the process of holding discussions with individuals or groups of individuals to
                facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.</li>
            <li>And finally, the test method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities,
                mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual with expected behavior.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>


    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Assessment Scope</h5>
        <p>
            Prior to a CMMC assessment, the contractor must define the scope for the assessment that represents the
            boundary
            for which the CMMC certificate will be issued.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Contractor Size</h5>
        <p>
            The CMMC assessment methodology follows a data-centric security process that applies the practices equally,
            regardless of the contractor’s size, constraints, or complexity. All CMMC levels are achievable by small,
            medium, and large contractors.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>
        The Assessment Process
    </h4>

    <div class="mb-4">

        <h5>The Interview</h5>
        <p> An organization's assessor should have discussions with various individuals within the organization to
            understand if a practice has been addressed. Interviews of pertinent staff (often at different
            organizational levels) helps determine if practices are implemented and if adequate resources, planning, and
            training are available to help achieve CMMC goals.
        <p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Review of Assessment Objects</h5>
        <p> The assessor will review, inspect, observe, study and analyze documents, mechanisms, and activities. The
            assessor reviews documentation to determine if assessment objectives are met. Interviews with contractor
            staff may identify the documents the contractor uses. Documents must be final drafts; working papers
            (drafts) of documentation are not eligible as they are not yet official. Common types of documents that can
            be used as evidence include applicable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>policy, process, and procedures</li>
            <li>training materials</li>
            <li>plans and planning documents</li>
            <li>system-level, network, and data flow diagrams</li>
        </ul>
        If a contractor doesn't have certain documents, other documents may be used to provide evidence.
        In some cases, the practice is best assessed by viewing the safeguards in place for hardware, associated
        configuration information, or observing a process in action.
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>What Is Tested</h5>
        <p>
            Testing is an important part of the assessment process. Interviews tell the assessor what the contractor
            staff believe to be true, documentation provides evidence of intent, and testing demonstrates what has or
            has not been done. For example, contractor staff may talk about how users are identified, documentation may
            provide details on how users are identified, but seeing a demonstration of identifying users provides
            evidence that the practice is met. The Certified Assessor will determine which practices, or objectives
            within a practice need demonstration or testing. Not all practices will require testing.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 1</h5>
        <p> Level 1 safeguards Federal Contract Information (FCI). Level 1 encompasses the basic safeguarding
            requirements
            for FCI specified in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.204-21, which defines FCI as:<br>
            <em>Information, not intended for public release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under
                a
                contract to develop or deliver a product or service to the Government, but not including information
                provided by the Government to the public (such as on public websites) or simple transactional
                information,
                such as necessary to process payments.</em><br>
            Department of Defense (DoD) contracts that specify the need for a contractor to process, store, or transmit
            FCI
            only require the contractor to comply with CMMC Level 1 practices. There is no CMMC process maturity
            assessed at
            Level 1.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">

        <h5>Level 2</h5>
        <p> Level 2 is a transitional level. At Level 2, a contractor is not yet approved for CUI. CMMC Level 2
            practices
            and processes provide additional safeguarding above CMMC Level 1 and help to prepare a contractor to handle
            CUI
            at CMMC Level 3.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">

        <h5>Level 3</h5>
        <p> CMMC Level 3 addresses the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The National Archives
            and
            Record Administration (NARA) defines CUI as:</p>

        <p class="font-italic">Information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and
            consistent
            with laws, regulations, and government-wide policies, excluding information that is classified under
            Executive
            Order 13526, Classified National Security Information, December 29, 2009, or any predecessor or successor
            order,
            or Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.</p>

        <p>A CMMC Level 3 assessment encompasses the practices and processes of CMMC Levels 1, 2, and 3. CMMC Level 3
            shows
            that a contractor can adequately protect CUI at the appropriate risk level while accounting for
            subcontractor
            information flow in a multi-tier supply chain.</p>

    <div class="mb-4">
        <h5>Level 4</h5>
        <p>Levels 4 provides increased assurance to the DoD that a contractor is capable of protecting CUI while working
            to
            reduce the risk of Advanced Persistent Threats and focuses on the protection of CUI from APTs. It
            encompasses
            cybersecurity best practices along with enhanced security requirements from NIST SP 800-171B . These

        <h5>Practice Findings</h5>
        <p>The assessment of a CMMC practice or process results in one of three possible findings: MET, NOT MET, or NOT
            APPLICABLE. To achieve a specific CMMC Level 1, for example, a contractor will need a finding of MET or NOT
            APPLICABLE on all Level 1 practices.</p>

        <p>The CMMC Practices are presented in the following format in the assessment:</p>

        <p><strong>MET</strong> is presented as <strong>Yes</strong> in the CSET Assessment Tool. The contractor
            successfully meets the practice. For each
            practice marked MET, the assessor includes statements that indicate the response conforms to the objectives
            and
            documents the appropriate evidence to support the response.</p>

        <p>For <strong>MET (Yes)</strong>, the assessor can use the <strong>Observations</strong> field to record
            applicable
            observations.</p>

        <p><strong>NOT MET</strong> is presented as <strong>NO</strong> in the CSET Assessment tool. The contractor has
            not
            met the practice. For each
            practice marked NOT MET, the assessor includes statements that explain why and documents the appropriate
            evidence that the contractor does not conform to the objectives.</p>

        <p>For <strong>NOT MET (No)</strong>, the assessor can use the <strong>Observations</strong> field to record
            applicable observations.</p>

        <h5>Inherited Practice Objectives</h5>
        <p>A contractor can inherit practice objectives. A practice objective that is inherited is met because adequate
            evidence is provided that the enterprise or another entity, such as an External Service Provider (ESP),
            performs
            the practice objective. Evidence from the enterprise or the entity from which the objectives are inherited
            should show they are applicable to in-scope assets and that the assessment objectives are met. For each
            practice
            objective that is inherited, the assessor includes statements that indicate how they were evaluated and from
            whom they are inherited. If the contractor cannot demonstrate adequate evidence for all assessment
            objectives,
            through either contractor evidence or evidence of inheritance, the contractor will receive a NOT MET for the
            practice.</p>

        <p><strong>NOT APPLICABLE (N/A)</strong> is presented as <strong>NA</strong> in the CSET Assessment Tool. The
            practice does not apply for the
            assessment. For each practice marked N/A, the assessor is required to include a statement that explains why
            the
            practice does not apply to the contractor. </p>

        <p>For <strong>NOT APPLICABLE (N/A)</strong> the assessor is required to enter comments in the pop-up text box
