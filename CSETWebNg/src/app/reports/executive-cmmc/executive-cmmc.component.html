      <h1>Advisory</h1>
      <p>
          CSET® is only one component of the overall cyber security picture and should be complemented with a robust
          cyber security program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of
          security
          weaknesses, and should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture.
      </p>

      <p>
          The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network
          hardware/software configuration review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex
          risk assessment. CSET® is not
          intended as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained
          professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach
          including facility walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices.
          Consideration should also be
          given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or
          non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not
          compromise
          production or safety.
      </p>

      <p>
          CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team consisting
          of representatives
          from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential. The
          representatives
          must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one individual has
          the
          span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.
      </p>

      <p>
          Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a
          manner appropriate
          to their sensitivity.
