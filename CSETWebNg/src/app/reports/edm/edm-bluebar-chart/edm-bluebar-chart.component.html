Maturity Indicator Levels provide a combined measurement of the completeness of EDM practices, as well as the enterprise management
activities necessary to ensure that this capability is sustained over time, despite disruptions or organizational changes. The MIL scale is
cumulative; each MIL level must be complete before achieving a higher MIL is possible. Viewed collectively, these depictions provide an
understanding of overall performance. While achieving a certain Maturity Indicator Level is one possible process improvement objective, it may
not be the most importantobjective for every organization or in every context.
