    <h1>Advisory</h1>
    <p>
      CSET® is only one component of the overall cybersecurity picture and should be complemented with a robust
      cybersecurity program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of
      security
      weaknesses, and should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network
      hardware/software configuration review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex
      risk assessment. CSET® is not
      intended as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained
      professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach
      including facility walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices.
      Consideration should also be
      given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or
      non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not
      compromise
      production or safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team consisting
      of representatives
      from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential. The
      representatives
      must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one individual has
      the
      span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a
      manner appropriate
      to their sensitivity.

      Maturity Indicator Levels provide a combined measurement of the completeness of EDM practices, as well as the
      enterprise management activities necessary to ensure that this capability is sustained over time, despite disruptions or organizational
      changes. The MIL scale is cumulative; each MIL level must be complete before achieving a higher MIL is possible. Viewed collectively, these
      depictions provide an understanding of overall performance. While achieving a certain Maturity Indicator Level is one possible process
      improvement objective, it may not be the most important objective for every organization or in every context.

    <h1 class="pageHeader">Relationship Formation</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of Relationship Formation is to assess whether the acquirer evaluates and controls the risks
      of relying on external entities before entering into relationships with them. Relationship Formation includes
      understanding the acquirer’s critical services, having a process for entering into formal relationships, and
      evaluating external entities. A key aspect of Relationship Formation is identifying resilience requirements
      as the basis for risk management and formal agreements. Resilience requirements typically focus on
      integrity, confidentiality, and availability, but can also include other requirements important to the critical
      service.

          A fundamental risk management principle is to focus on activities to protect and sustain services and
          assets that most directly affect the acquirer's ability to achieve its mission. This practice refers to
          identifying the assessed acquirer's high-value services, which it provides to its customers and other
          stakeholders. <br/><br/>

          Systems and Organizations”, The Fundamentals, 2.1 Multitiered Risk Management. <br/><br/>
          To integrate the risk management process throughout the organization and more effectively address
          mission/business concerns, a three-tiered approach is employed that addresses risk at the: (i)
          <span style="font-style: italic;">organizational</span> level; (ii) <span style="font-style: italic;">mission/business</span> process level; 
          and (iii) <span style="font-style: italic;">information system</span> level. <br/><br/>

          Prioritize and document the list of high-value services that must be provided if a disruption occurs.
          Consideration of the consequences of the loss of high-value acquirer services is typically performed as
          part of a business impact analysis. In addition, the consequences of risks to high-value services are
          identified and analyzed in risk assessment activities. The acquirer must consider this information when
          prioritizing high-value services. <br/><br/>

          An acquirer must be able to identify its high-value assets, document them, and establish their value. This
          is done in order to develop strategies for protecting and sustaining assets commensurate with their value
          to services. The term high-value assets refers both to assets that are internal to the assessed acquirer
          and those that are owned, maintained, provided, etc. by external entities. <br/><br/>
