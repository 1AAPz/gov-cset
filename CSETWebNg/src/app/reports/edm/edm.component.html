    <h1>Advisory</h1>
    <p>
      CSET® is only one component of the overall cybersecurity picture and should be complemented with a robust
      cybersecurity program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of
      security
      weaknesses, and should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network
      hardware/software configuration review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex
      risk assessment. CSET® is not
      intended as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained
      professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach
      including facility walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices.
      Consideration should also be
      given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or
      non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not
      compromise
      production or safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team consisting
      of representatives
      from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential. The
      representatives
      must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one individual has
      the
      span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a
      manner appropriate
      to their sensitivity.

      Maturity Indicator Levels provide a combined measurement of the completeness of EDM practices, as well as the
      enterprise management activities necessary to ensure that this capability is sustained over time, despite
      disruptions or organizational changes. The MIL scale is cumulative; each MIL level must be complete before achieving a higher MIL is possible.
      Viewed collectively, these depictions provide an understanding of overall performance. While achieving a certain Maturity Indicator Level is
      one possible process improvement objective, it may not be the most important objective for every organization or in every context.

      The purpose of Relationship Formation is to assess whether the acquirer evaluates and controls the risks
      of relying on external entities before entering into relationships with them. Relationship Formation includes
      understanding the acquirer’s critical services, having a process for entering into formal relationships, and
      evaluating external entities. A key aspect of Relationship Formation is identifying resilience requirements
      as the basis for risk management and formal agreements. Resilience requirements typically focus on
      integrity, confidentiality, and availability, but can also include other requirements important to the critical
      service.

          A fundamental risk management principle is to focus on activities to protect and sustain services and

          For each external dependency, establish a list of resilience specifications that apply to the responsible
          external entity. The process for determining and documenting the resilience specifications that apply to
          an external dependency and entity will vary based on the action of the entity in relation to the acquirer's
          operations, the priority of the external dependency, and the management structure within the acquirer. At
          a minimum, the resilience specifications should include a clear and definitive statement of the external
          entity's services, support, products, assets, or staff on which the acquirer relies.
          Requirements should be gathered and documented for each type of external dependency. Even in cases
          where it is not practical to include these requirements in formal agreements with external entities, they
          are useful as a way to assess and manage risks against external dependencies. <br /><br />

          From a resilience perspective, the selection process for external entities is often an extension of or
          supplement to the organization's standard procurement processes. Resilience specifications may simply
          serve as additional requirements for consideration and evaluation as part of the standard procurement
          process. In all cases, due diligence should be performed on candidate external entities to evaluate their
          ability to meet the resilience specifications that have been established for the actions they hope to
          perform for the organization. <br /><br />
          In some cases, external entities cannot be selected from a pool of candidates; they may be inherited in
          the course of an acquisition or merger or they may be the only provider of a high-value service on which
          the organization depends (this is often the case for public services). In cases in which external entities
          cannot be selected, the due diligence process for selection should still be performed to identify any
          specifications that are not met by the external entity. It may be appropriate to alter the specifications by
          changing the actions or nature of the dependence on the external entity to resolve the unmet specifications.
          In cases where the specifications cannot be changed, any unmet specifications should be treated as risks.

            Supplemental Guidance:
            Supplier reviews include, for example:</span>(i) analysis of supplier processes used to design, develop,
          test, implement, verify, deliver, and support information systems, system components, and information
          system services; and (ii) assessment of supplier training and experience in developing systems,

          Because of the pervasive nature of operational risk, a comprehensive operational risk management
          strategy is needed to ensure proper consideration of risk and the effects on operational resilience. The
          strategy provides a common foundation for the performance of operational risk management activities
          (which are typically dispersed throughout the organization) and for the collection, coordination, and
          elevation of operational risk to the organization's enterprise risk management process. <br /><br />
          Preparation for operational risk management requires the organization to develop and maintain a
          strategy for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating operational risks. This strategy is documented in a risk
          management plan and addresses the activities that the organization performs enterprise-wide to carry
          out a continuous risk management program. This includes identifying the sources and types of
          operational risk and establishing a strategy that details the organization's approach, activities, and
          objectives for managing these risks as a fundamental operational resilience management process. <br /><br />

          <span style="font-style: italic;">Managing risk is a complex, multifaceted activity that requires the
            involvement of the entire organization</span>-
          from senior leaders/executives providing the strategic vision and top-level goals and objectives for the
          organization; to mid-level leaders planning, executing, and managing projects; to individuals on the front
          lines operating the information systems supporting the organization's missions/business functions. Risk
          management is a comprehensive process that requires organizations to: (i) frame risk (i.e., establish the
          context for risk-based decisions); (ii) assess risk; (iii) respond to risk once determined; and (iv) monitor
          risk on an ongoing basis using effective organizational communications and a feedback loop for
          continuous improvement in the risk-related activities of organizations. Risk management is carried out as
          a holistic, organization-wide activity that addresses risk from the strategic level to the tactical level,
          ensuring that risk- based decision making is integrated into every aspect of the organization. <br /><br />

          <br /><br />
          Identification of risks due to external dependencies requires an understanding of the actions of the
          associated external entity in the operation, support, or resilience of the organization's services. External
          entities will be responsible for varying dependencies in the support of the organization's operations.

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[RISK:SG1:SP1]</span> Determine Risk Sources and Categories. <br /><br />
          The sources of risk to assets and services are identified and the categories of risk that are relevant to
          the organization are determined. <br /><br />
          Identifying risk sources helps the organization to determine and categorize the types of operational risk
          that are most likely to affect day-to-day operations and to seed an organization-specific risk taxonomy
          that can be used as a tool for managing risk on a continuous basis as operating conditions change and
          evolve. The sources of risk can be both internal and external to the organization. <br /><br />
          Categorizing operational risks provides the organization a means from which to perform advanced
          analysis and mitigation activities that allow for similar types of risks to be effectively neutralized or
          contained by limited actions by the organization. <br /><br />

          All agreement provisions should be documented in the agreement in language that is unambiguous. <br /><br />
          The agreement <span style="font-style: italic;">should not contain any general exceptions for achieving the
            resilience specifications
            unless they are carefully considered and negotiated.</span> It may, however, contain scenarios of types of
          unforeseen events for which the external entity is not expected to prepare. Any exceptions granted to
          resilience specifications or scenarios for which the external entity is not required to prepare should be
          treated as risks under EXD:SG2. <br /><br />
          All agreements should <span style="font-style: italic;">establish and enable procedures for monitoring the
            performance of external
            entities</span> and inspecting the services or products they deliver to the organization. <br /><br />

      The purpose of Relationship Management and Governance is to assess whether the acquirer manages
      ongoing relationships to maintain the resilience of the critical service, and mitigate dependency risk. This
      includes identifying the external entities that support the critical service, ongoing risk management,
      communicating with external entities about key aspects of protecting the critical service, and controlling

          It is important for the organization to identify and characterize external dependencies so that they can be
          understood, formalized, monitored, and managed as part of the organization's comprehensive risk
          management process. <br /><br />
          The organization's list of services should be examined to discover services that may be subject to
          external dependencies, in whole or in part. The organization's inventory of assets should also be
          examined to discover assets that are under the control of external entities or are in other ways subject to
          external dependencies. The organization may find value and efficiency in establishing close service links
          or overlap to facilitate information sharing between the external dependencies list, the services listing,
          and the asset inventory. The organization's customer database and supplier database may also be
          valuable sources of insight when establishing the catalog of external dependencies. The organization's
          set of current supplier and vendor contracts and related service level agreements (SLAs) are additional
          sources. <br /><br />

        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">CERT-RMM Reference</span> <br />
          Consider developing a plan for performing External Dependencies Management. A plan is developed 
          to ensure that the acquirer and its staff know how external dependencies will be managed across the 
          entire lifecycle of relationships. External dependencies exist when external entities have defined obligations 
          or relationships with assets or services that the acquirer depends on to support the critical service. Examples 
          include external entities that provide, operate, control, have access to, own, or have other responsibilities with 
          respect to key assets. <br/> <br/>
          The plan should address the resilience specifications for the critical service or the product being provided. The EDM plan 
          should detail how core goals relating to EDM will be performed - for example evaluating suppliers, entering into formal agreements, 
          monitoring changes at external entities, and prioritizing dependencies. The EDM plan will normally also detail the other resilience 
          and security domains that are relevant to EDM at the acquirer. These may include, for example, risk management, incident management, 
          service continuity, or change management. This is important so that the resilience processes across the acquirer will adequately 
          support EDM according to consistent requirements and priorities. <br/><br/>
          In practice, many of the required actions to manage external dependencies may be documented in other plans or documents (for example vendor selection and contracting procedures).
          The purpose of an EDM plan is not to duplicate or repeat material in other plans or documentation, but rather to clarify and harmonize the roles and responsibilities of staff and 
          processes across the acquirer. For example, the acquirer's service continuity plan may include actions involving suppliers in the event of a natural disaster. <br><br/>
          The EDM plan, on the other hand, may detail roles, responsibilities, and processes to ensure that continuity plans are updated based on relevant changes, for example contractual 
          changes that may affect service continuity. The plan may detail how different functions or departments will coordinate their efforts to support EDM. <br/><br/> 
          Plans should explain:
          <ul>
            <li>who performs EDM practices</li>
            <li>key stakeholders</li>
            <li>when and how often they are performed, and</li>
            <li>the key processes involved in EDM</li>
          </ul>
          Typical items addressed in an EDM plan may include:
          <ul>
            <li>identifying and prioritizing external dependencies</li>
            <li>associating external dependencies with services and assets</li>
            <li>managing operational risks resulting from external dependencies</li>
            <li>evaluating and selecting external entities</li>
            <li>formalizing and enforcing agreements with external entities, including changing provisions</li>
            <li>terminations of relationships with external entities</li>
            <li>integrating external dependencies into incident management and service continuity planning and exercising</li>
          </ul> <br/>
          Sub practices:
          <ul>
            <li>Document the plan</li>
            <li>Document the process description</li>
            <li>Review the plan with relevant stakeholders and obtain their agreement</li>
            <li>Revise the plan as necessary</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          Consider developing policies for external dependencies management. Policy consists of high level statements 
          by organizational leadership concerning external dependencies management. The purpose of policy is to 
          establish and maintain governance over the planning and performance of external dependencies management. 
          Policy will typically address:
          <ul>
            <li>responsibility, authority, and ownership for performing activities</li>
            <li>the importance of external dependencies management</li>
            <li>the acquirer's approach to its critical services and their prioritization</li>
            <li>methods for measuring adherence to policy, granting exceptions, and identifying policy violations</li>
            <li>consequences for noncompliance with policy</li>
            <li>the acquirer's approach to selecting suppliers and external entities</li>
            <li>the acquirer's approach to risk management as it pertains to external dependencies</li>
            <li>enterprise requirements or policies to which external entities are expected to adhere</li>
            <li>monitoring the performance of external entities</li>
            <li>issue escalation and dispute resolution</li>
            <li>applying corrective action to relationships with external entities as specified in formal agreements</li>
            <li>terminating relationships with external entities as specified in formal agreements</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">CERT-RMM Reference</span> <br />
          Consider including process descriptions for EDM in policy or plan documents. Process descriptions document 
          the series of actions or specific steps that are necessary to perform external dependencies management activities 
          in a repeatable, predictable manner. <br/>
          Examples may include:
          <ul>
            <li>the process to form supplier relationships, for example the steps ("gates") and approval authorities required for new relationships</li>
            <li>the actions required to purchase or invest in new technology</li>
            <li>processes to ensure the external entity concerns are included in risk management. For example, 
              these may include a process to ensure that supplier performance problems are entered into risk 
              registers or other risk monitoring tools.</li>
            <li>the process to identify external dependencies, for example processes involving checking internal 
              financial statements to identify supplier relationships outside the formal relationship management program.</li>
            <li>the process to make changes to plans that involve external dependencies management, for example the service continuity, risk management, or incident management plans.</li>
            <li>the process to make sure that requirements for infrastructure providers and governmental services are managed. For example, these processes may focus on advising the
               corporate staff who interface with infrastructure and governmental authorities about changes and threats to the critical service.</li>
            <li>the process to transition supplier relationships including, for example, the input of technical staff or critical service business owners at the acquirer.</li>
            <li>the process to manage external entity access to the acquirer, for example the process to remove access when contractor staff are terminated or change staff positions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">CERT-RMM Reference</span> <br />
          Consider identifying stakeholders of the EDM process and engaging them to ensure they are aware of their roles. Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>internal and external owners and custodians of organizational assets</li>
            <li>internal and external service owners</li>
            <li>organizational unit and line of business managers responsible for high-value assets and the services the support</li>
            <li>staff responsible for managing operational risk</li>
            <li>staff responsible for establishing, implementing, and maintaining an internal control system for organizational assets</li>
            <li>staff required to develop, test, implement, and execute service continuity plans that involve external dependencies</li>
            <li>acquisition and procurement staff</li>
            <li>internal and external auditors</li>
          </ul> <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">CERT-RMM Reference</span> <br />
          Consider developing standards and guidelines for external dependencies management. Examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>criteria for prioritizing external dependencies</li>
            <li>templates that define the information required to identify, track and manage external dependencies in databases or information repositories</li>
            <li>the guidelines and standards required to make risk statements and impact valuations</li>
            <li>agreement templates, including enterprise specifications that apply to external entities</li>
            <li>standard RFPs, including applicable requirements</li>
            <li>criteria for selecting external entities</li>
            <li>performance-monitoring report standards and templates</li>
            <li>inspection reports on deliverables</li>
            <li>corrective-action report standards and examples</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
