    <h1>Advisory</h1>
    <p>
      CSET® is only one component of the overall cybersecurity picture and should be complemented with a robust
      cybersecurity program within the organization. A self-assessment with CSET® cannot reveal all types of
      security
      weaknesses, and should not be the sole means of determining an organization’s security posture.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tool will not provide a detailed architectural analysis of the network or a detailed network
      hardware/software configuration review. It is not a risk analysis tool so it will not generate a complex
      risk assessment. CSET® is not
      intended as a substitute for in depth analysis of control system vulnerabilities as performed by trained
      professionals. Periodic onsite reviews and inspections must still be conducted using a holistic approach
      including facility walk downs, interviews, and observation and examination of facility practices.
      Consideration should also be
      given to additional steps including scanning, penetration testing, and exercises on surrogate, training, or
      non-production systems, or systems where failures, unexpected faults, or other unexpected results will not
      compromise
      production or safety.
    </p>

    <p>
      CSET® assessments cannot be completed effectively by any one individual. A cross-functional team consisting
      of representatives
      from operational, maintenance, information technology, business, and security areas is essential. The
      representatives
      must be subject matter experts with significant expertise in their respective areas. No one individual has
      the
      span of responsibility or knowledge to effectively answer all the questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data and reports generated by the tool should be managed securely and marked, stored, and distributed in a
      manner appropriate
      to their sensitivity.

      Maturity Indicator Levels provide a combined measurement of the completeness of EDM practices, as well as the
      enterprise management activities necessary to ensure that this capability is sustained over time, despite
      disruptions or organizational
      changes. The MIL scale is cumulative; each MIL level must be complete before achieving a higher MIL is possible.
      Viewed collectively, these
      depictions provide an understanding of overall performance. While achieving a certain Maturity Indicator Level is
      one possible process
      improvement objective, it may not be the most important objective for every organization or in every context.

    <h1 class="pageHeader">Relationship Formation</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of Relationship Formation is to assess whether the acquirer evaluates and controls the risks
      of relying on external entities before entering into relationships with them. Relationship Formation includes
      understanding the acquirer’s critical services, having a process for entering into formal relationships, and
      evaluating external entities. A key aspect of Relationship Formation is identifying resilience requirements
      as the basis for risk management and formal agreements. Resilience requirements typically focus on
      integrity, confidentiality, and availability, but can also include other requirements important to the critical
      service.

          For each external dependency, establish a list of resilience specifications that apply to the responsible

          From a resilience perspective, the selection process for external entities is often an extension of or
          supplement to the organization's standard procurement processes. Resilience specifications may simply
          serve as additional requirements for consideration and evaluation as part of the standard procurement
          process. In all cases, due diligence should be performed on candidate external entities to evaluate their
          ability to meet the resilience specifications that have been established for the actions they hope to
          perform for the organization. <br /><br />
          In some cases, external entities cannot be selected from a pool of candidates; they may be inherited in
          the course of an acquisition or merger or they may be the only provider of a high-value service on which
          the organization depends (this is often the case for public services). In cases in which external entities
          cannot be selected, the due diligence process for selection should still be performed to identify any
          specifications that are not met by the external entity. It may be appropriate to alter the specifications by
          changing the actions or nature of the dependence on the external entity to resolve the unmet specifications.
          In cases where the specifications cannot be changed, any unmet specifications should be treated as risks.

          Because of the pervasive nature of operational risk, a comprehensive operational risk management
          strategy is needed to ensure proper consideration of risk and the effects on operational resilience. The
          strategy provides a common foundation for the performance of operational risk management activities
          (which are typically dispersed throughout the organization) and for the collection, coordination, and
          elevation of operational risk to the organization's enterprise risk management process. <br /><br />
          Preparation for operational risk management requires the organization to develop and maintain a
          strategy for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating operational risks. This strategy is documented in a risk
          management plan and addresses the activities that the organization performs enterprise-wide to carry
          out a continuous risk management program. This includes identifying the sources and types of
          operational risk and establishing a strategy that details the organization's approach, activities, and
          objectives for managing these risks as a fundamental operational resilience management process. <br /><br />

          management is a comprehensive process that requires organizations to: (i) frame risk (i.e., establish the
          context for risk-based decisions); (ii) assess risk; (iii) respond to risk once determined; and (iv) monitor
          risk on an ongoing basis using effective organizational communications and a feedback loop for
          continuous improvement in the risk-related activities of organizations. Risk management is carried out as
          a holistic, organization-wide activity that addresses risk from the strategic level to the tactical level,
          ensuring that risk- based decision making is integrated into every aspect of the organization. <br /><br />

          <br /><br />
          Identification of risks due to external dependencies requires an understanding of the actions of the

          entities will be responsible for varying dependencies in the support of the organization's operations.

          The sources of risk to assets and services are identified and the categories of risk that are relevant to
          the organization are determined. <br /><br />
          Identifying risk sources helps the organization to determine and categorize the types of operational risk
          that are most likely to affect day-to-day operations and to seed an organization-specific risk taxonomy
          that can be used as a tool for managing risk on a continuous basis as operating conditions change and
          evolve. The sources of risk can be both internal and external to the organization. <br /><br />
          Categorizing operational risks provides the organization a means from which to perform advanced
          analysis and mitigation activities that allow for similar types of risks to be effectively neutralized or
          contained by limited actions by the organization. <br /><br />

          Establish and maintain a solicitation package that includes the requirements and proposal evaluation
          criteria. Solicitation packages are used to seek proposals from potential suppliers. The acquirer
          structures the solicitation package to facilitate an accurate and complete response from each potential
          supplier and to enable an effective comparison and evaluation of proposals. <br /><br />
          The solicitation package includes a description of the desired form of the response, the relevant
          statement of work for the supplier, and required provisions in the supplier agreement (e.g., a copy of the
          standard supplier agreement or non-disclosure provisions). In government acquisitions, some or all of
          the content and structure of the solicitation package can be defined by regulation. <br /><br />
          The solicitation package is rigorous to ensure consistent and comparable responses but flexible enough

          System integrators are those entities that provide customized services to the acquirer including custom
          development, test, operations, and maintenance. This group usually replies to a request for proposal
          from an acquirer with a proposal that describes solution or services that are customized to the acquirer's
          requirements. Such proposals provided by system integrators can include many layers of suppliers (see
          Chapter 3.3.2). <span style="font-style: italic;"> The system integrator should ensure that those suppliers
            are vetted and verified with
            respect to the acquirer's ICT SCRM requirements. </span> Because of the level of visibility that can be
          obtained
          in the relationship with the system integrator, the acquirer has the ability to require rigorous supplier
          acceptance criteria as well as any relevant countermeasures to address identified or potential risks.
          <br /><br />
          Organizations should consider that the costs of doing business with suppliers may be directly impacted
          by the level of <span style="font-style: italic;">visibility the suppliers allow into how they apply security
            and supply chain practices</span> to
          their solutions. When organizations or system integrators require greater levels of transparency from
          suppliers, they must consider the possible cost implications of such requirements. Suppliers may select
          to not participate in procurements to avoid increased costs or perceived risks to their intellectual
          property, limiting an organization's supply or technology choices. The risk to suppliers is the potential for
          multiple, different sets of requirements that they may have to individually comply with, which may not be
          scalable. <br /><br />
